    <p>I am programmer who likes programming in Front end technologies such
      as Python, HTML/CSS, Javascipt and frame work such as Django. In addition
      to these, I can also manage database using PostgreSQL or MySQL. Hence, you
      can say me that I am a Full Stack Developer as a whole. Hence, I can
      develop applications using the power of Python and display it in a nice
      and neat wayon a webbrowser. If you are interested in doing collabaration
      with me, then you may use the contact firm <em>here</em> to discuss
      further. Thanks!!

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Class 10<sup>th</sup><em> (2005)</em>: <p>I studied my class 10<sup>
      th</sup> from <i>Sunbeam School Bhagwanpur, Varanasi</i> and passed it
      with <em>78.60%</em></p>
      </li>
      <li>Class 12<sup>th</sup><em> (2007)</em>: <p>From the same school,
      I studied my class 12 <sup>th</sup> as well and passed it with a percentage
      of <em>85.40%</em>. My major subjects in the class were: <em>Maths, Physics,
      Chemistry and Computer Science</em></p>
      </li>
      <li>Int. B.Tech(Applied Petroleum Engineering) + MBA (Oil and Gas)
      <em> (2014)</em>: <p>I did my graduation and post graduation (both) from the
      <em>University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (Dehradun).</em> It involved
      the study of petroleum rocks, process of deducting the source, marking,
      estimation, drilling, storing and transportation. Actually, this involves
      a complex cycle of processes of various domain like from Geology (for deduction
      to estimation), Mechanical Engineering (Drilling) and Logistics (Transportation).
      However, we were given training of interpretation of results from various
      sources which made us capable of deciding which process will suit the most
      for extration of the natural resouce
